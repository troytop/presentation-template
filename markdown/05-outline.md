## Abstract:

Kubernetes is a superb platform for containers but is it the right interface
for people writing code? Numerous projects have sprung up over the past two
years to simplify the deployment of code to containers, but what if the best
solution was an opinionated Platform-as-a-Service framework that's been around
for years? This talk presents the case that with the Eirini and Quarks
projects, Cloud Foundry makes an ideal developer interface to Kubernetes and a
good structured platform for cooperating with the IT Operators who manage
Kubernetes infrastructure.

* Why am I here?
  * to prevent the reinvention of yet another DevOps wheel
  * to get evangelical about the software I've been working with for eight years

* Assumptions: What can we agree on to start?
  * containers are a great way to deliver software
  * containers are replacing virtual machines for a lot of use cases
  * Kubernetes is the de-facto orchestration system for containers
  * Kubernetes seems to be displacing IaaS platforms (e.g. Open Stack)
  * Kubernetes has just as much of a learning curve as its predecessors
